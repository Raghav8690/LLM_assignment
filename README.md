# LLM_assignment

*Create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to upload documents and
ask questions based on their content. The system should leverage vector databases for efficient retrieval
and an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, or another REST-based model) for generating responses. The entire
application should be containerized using Docker and deployable on cloud or local environments.*
